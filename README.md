"One must be chopped and cooked before they serve and eat". <br>
Can I code? no. Did I understand <50% of terminology sent in the WIT introduction email? Yes. Should I have done non-tech? Maybe
Will I still do this? 100%%%%%%<br>
This is the read Me before the hackathon begins!! I can only make cool website designs.... 3 years ago so I hope something triggers in me... to be updated when we have a real idea....

- Successful expansion to other Meta apps

## üö® Hackathon Implementation

This is a frontend demo showcasing the user experience. For a full implementation, you would need:

1. **Backend API** - Flask/Node.js server for detection processing
2. **AI Models** - Deepfake detection algorithms (Xception, HuggingFace)
3. **Database** - User activity tracking and account monitoring
4. **Real-time Processing** - Video analysis pipeline
5. **Content Moderation** - Human review workflows

## üé™ Demo Flow

1. **Browse Feed** - See different post types and detection levels
2. **Level 1 Warning** - Tap celebrity post to see sliding warning
3. **Level 2 Intervention** - Click political post to see freeze modal
4. **Educational Content** - Explore "See Why" panels and learning resources
5. **Account Flagging** - Notice high-volume AI content warnings

## üèÜ Pitch Summary
